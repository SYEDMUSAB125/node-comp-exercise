# Node.js, Express, and MongoDB

Node.js, Express, and MongoDB are a powerful combination of technologies for building modern web applications. This repository serves as a guide to help you get started with this trio, demonstrating how they work together to create scalable, efficient, and flexible web solutions.

## Technologies

### Node.js

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is a JavaScript runtime environment that enables server-side JavaScript execution. It provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it highly efficient for building real-time and data-intensive applications.

### Express

[Express](https://expressjs.com/) is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. It simplifies routing, handling HTTP requests and responses, and integrating with various template engines and databases.

### MongoDB

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a NoSQL database designed for flexibility and scalability. It stores data in a flexible JSON-like format (BSON) and is well-suited for handling large volumes of data.

## How They Work Together

Node.js serves as the runtime environment for your Express application. Express provides a framework for building the web application, defining routes, and handling HTTP requests. MongoDB stores your application's data in a flexible and scalable manner, allowing you to work with JSON-like documents.

## Getting Started

To start using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for your project, follow these steps:

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.

2. Clone this repository or create your own project.

3. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.

4. Set up your MongoDB database or use a cloud-based service like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).

5. Configure your database connection in your Express application.

6. Build your application by defining routes, controllers, and models.

7. Run your application using `npm start` or your preferred method.

## Examples

Check out the example applications in this repository to see Node.js, Express, and MongoDB in action:

- [Basic CRUD Operations](/examples/basic-crud): A simple Express application that demonstrates basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations with MongoDB.

- [Authentication with Passport.js](/examples/authentication): An Express application showcasing user authentication using the popular [Passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org/) library.
